This is the (not official) code implementation for this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9887963).

The dataset is sourced from [JNU Dataset](https://github.com/ClarkGableWang/JNU-Bearing-Dataset).

- python 3.10
- torch 2.0.1

1. Download the dataset form [JNU Dataset](https://github.com/ClarkGableWang/JNU-Bearing-Dataset)
2. Rename the downloaded dataset to utils.params.DATA_RAW_PATH(which is 'JNuData' now)
3. Remeber delete the '.git' and 'readme.md' files in the dataset floder
4. Run the code
